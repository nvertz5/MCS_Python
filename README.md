# MCS_Python
# Research-based notebooks for analyzing various nocturnal MCS events

# All of this code should work as of writing this readme. The only thing
# that someone would have to change is the file path to whatever RUC/WRF/Obs
# file that you would like to analyze.

# Python packages that one might not have, and thus need to install, are .....
### MetPy
### wrf-python
### Cartopy
### Basemap
# There are other packages used, but they are more common. All packages used are listed at
# the top of each notebook.

# Feel free to contact me with any questions and/or recommendations on how to improve
# any of these notebooks.
